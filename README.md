# Game-of-Life


Here is my version of the famous Game of Life cellular automaton programmed in python in its version 3 (3.2.2 to be precise).
It's a simple version, easy to understand (at least it seems to me ^^) and graphical (tkinter).
It is possible to modify the size of the grid, the size of the cells and the wait between each step.
The program also has a button to automatically draw Gosper's famous glider cannon.
